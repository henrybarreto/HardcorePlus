## How does it work?
It is trying to harder the survival changing some default features of the game, like:
- Increasing the damage from all sources
- Decreasing the damage that mobs taken
- Decreasing the amount of XP gained
- Giving some mobs negative effects
- Deleting dropped items from the player's death
and more are coming...
  
Actually, the plugin are under tests and changes will come in, so suggestion to improvements are so welcome, than feel 
free to open an issue with yours.

*I recommend to the server difficult to be in hard to get the better experience*
